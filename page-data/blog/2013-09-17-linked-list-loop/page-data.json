Interviewers in these types of questions will be more interested on how we handle pointers, how we use linked list properties etc. In this series I discuss some of the questions that appear in interviews for the linked lists.</p>\n<p>When working with singly linked list, we are typically given a link to the first node. Common operations on a singly linked list are iterating through all the nodes, adding to the list, or deleting from the list. Algorithms for these operations generally require a well formed linked list. That is a linked list without loops or cycles in it.</p>\n<p>If a linked list has a cycle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The malformed linked list has no end (no node ever has a null next pointer)</li>\n<li>The malformed linked list contains two links to some node</li>\n<li>Iterating through the malformed linked list will yield all nodes in the loop multiple times</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A malformed linked list with a loop causes iteration over the list to fail because the iteration will never reach the end of the list.
