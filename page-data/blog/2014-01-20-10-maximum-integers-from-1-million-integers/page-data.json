Finally heap sort all the sets of 10 elements and take top 10 among those. But the problem in this approach is where to store 10 elements from each heap. That may require a large amount of memory as we have billions of numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>Reuse top 20 elements</strong> from earlier heap in subsequent elements can solve this problem. I meant to take first block of 1000 elements and subsequent blocks of 990 elements each. Initially heapsort first set of 1000 numbers, took max 10 elements and mix them with 990 elements of 2<sup>nd</sup>set. Again heapsort these 1000 numbers (10 from first set and 990 from 2<sup>nd</sup> set), take 10 max element and mix those with 980 elements of 3<sup>rd</sup> set. Repeat the same exercise till last set of 990 (or less) elements and take max 20 elements from final heap. Those 10 elements will be your answer.</p>\n<p><strong>Complexity:</strong> O(n) = n/1000*(complexity of heapsort 1000 elements)</p>\n<p>Since complexity of heap sorting 1000 elements will be a constant so the __O(n) = N i.e. linear complexity __</p>","excerpt":"You Have File of Containing 1 Million Integers You need To Find 10 Maximum Integer Out of Them.How You Will Do That.
