Thus, it can be represented as a long string containing the characters A, C, G, and T. The field of bio-informatics involves storing and searching of DNA sequence data. What is a good data structure to facilitate storage and string match/search operation on this kind of data? Write a class that stores the DNA sequence and implement a method which takes another DNA sub-sequence and returns the position of this sub-sequence in the first DNA sequence.<br>\nThere are several linear time string matching algorithms. See<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm</a> for a list of such algorithms.<br>\nOften a data structure called Suffix Tree or PAT tree is used in DNA sequencing applications in the field of Bio-informatics. A Suffix tree data structure facilitates string match/search in <em>O(m)</em> complexity, where <em>m</em> is the length of the sub-string. It takes an initial <em>O(n)</em> time required to build the suffix tree.<br>\nOne concern with suffix tree is the high amount of space/memory needed. But, with a small alphabet ( only 4 characters in the DNA search problem ) , its not too bad. More over, there are some advanced techniques that can be used to further <a href=\"http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/321941.321946\">reduce the storage requirements</a>.<br>\nA thorough treatment of suffix trees can be found <a href=\"http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~sahni/dsaaj/enrich/c16/suffix.htm\">here</a>.</p>","excerpt":"The DNA double helix consists of a long strand of four bases: adenine (abbreviated A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) andthymine (T).
