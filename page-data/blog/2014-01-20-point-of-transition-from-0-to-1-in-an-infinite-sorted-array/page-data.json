We can apply reverse of BinarySearch approach.<br>\nWe can think of sorted infinite 0 and 1 array as infinite size bit stream on disk with 0 set bits followed by 1 bits.<br>\nApproach:<br>\nStart with first bit, if it is 1 we are lucky and got the switch index, else if it is 0 check the 2,4,8,16,32,64.... 2^n bits till we get first 1 set bit index say its 'i'. (We are moving by power of 2, rather than 3, 4 etc, because it minimizes the range of data to find the element). Now we have to find between index i/2 to i where the swich happened and this can be done by simple binary search (size of the array to look into is i/2).<br>\nTime Complexity: log(N), N is index at which switch happened.<br>\nAn even faster solution would be to use bit operators as they are faster so instead of comparing with you could XOR with 1 and the index where it gives a 0 on XORing is the required index where first 0 is present.</p>","excerpt":"Given an input array of size unknown with all 1's in the beginning and 0's in the end.
