For the given string, search in that hashtable.

Depending upon how we construct the trie, the complexity varies from O(n) to O(n*m) where n is the no.of characters in the given string, and m is the no.of different characters that we have in all the strings.<br>\nIn the trie, for each node, if we create children for all the possible characters, then the complexity will be O(n), where n is the no.of characters in the given string. The memory requirement will be high in this case.<br>\nIf we don't create children for all the possible characters, and create children only for the strings that exist in our set, then at each level, we have to search among the children to find the string. So, the complexity would be O(n*m) where n is the no.of characters in the given string, and m is the no.of different characters that we have in all the strings. In this case, we will not use extra memory.</p>","excerpt":"Given a string, search it in a set of strings (say among 1000s of string).
