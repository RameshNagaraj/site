However, since there are seats and crap in there taking up space and also since the spherical shape of a golf ball means there will be considerable empty space between them when stacked, I'll round down to 500,000 golf balls.</p>\n<p>Which sounds ludicrous. I would have spitballed no more than 100k. But I stand by my math.</p>\n<p>Of course, if we are talking about the kind of bus that George Bush went to school on or Barney Frank rides to work every day, it would be half that....or 250,000 golf balls.</p>","excerpt":"Answer: This is one of those questions Google asks just to see if the applicant can explain the key challenge to solving the problem.
