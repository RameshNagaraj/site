For example, we might make the following assumptions:_</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em>There are approximately 5,000,000 people living in Chicago.</em></li>\n<li><em>On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.</em></li>\n<li><em>Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.</em></li>\n<li><em>Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.</em></li>\n<li><em>It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.</em></li>\n<li><em>Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>From these assumptions we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is</em></p>\n<dl>\n<dd><em>(5,000,000 persons in Chicago) / (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 125,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.</em></dd>\n</dl>\n<p><em>And we can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs</em></p>\n<dl>\n<dd><em>(50 weeks/year)×(5 days/week)×(8 hours/day)×(1 piano tuning per 2 hours per piano tuner) = 1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner.</em></dd>\n</dl>\n<p><em>Dividing gives</em></p>\n<dl>\n<dd><em>(125,000 piano tuning per year in Chicago) / (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 125 piano tuners in Chicago.</em></dd>\n</dl>\n<p><em>A famous example of a Fermi-problem-like estimate is the [Drake equation](<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake</a></em>equation \"Drake equation\"), which seeks to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy.
