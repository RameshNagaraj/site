If they have a girl, they have another child. If they have a boy, they stop. What is the proportion of boys to girls in the country?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: This one caused quite the debate, but we figured it out following these steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you have 10 couples who have 10 babies. 5 will be girls. 5 will be boys. (Total babies made: 10, with 5 boys and 5 girls)</li>\n<li>The 5 couples who had girls will have 5 babies. Half (2.5) will be girls. Half (2.5) will be boys. Add 2.5 boys to the 5 already born and 2.5 girls to the 5 already born. (Total babies made: 15, with 7.5 boys and 7.5 girls.)</li>\n<li>The 2.5 couples that had girls will have 2.5 babies. Half (1.25) will be boys and half (1.25) will be girls. Add 1.25 boys to the 7.5 boys already born and 1.25 girls to the 7.5 already born. (Total babies: 17.5 with 8.75 boys and 8.75 girls).</li>\n<li>And so on, maintianing a 50/50 population.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/answers-to-15-google-interview-questions-that-will-make-you-feel-stupid-2009-11?op=1#ixzz2sHZEhAZr\">http://www.businessinsider.com/answers-to-15-google-interview-questions-that-will-make-you-feel-stupid-2009-11?op=1#ixzz2sHZEhAZr</a></p>","excerpt":"Read more: http://www.businessinsider.com/answers-to-15-google-interview-questions-that-will-make-you-feel-stupid-2009-11?op=1#ixzz2sHZEhAZr","frontmatter":{"date":"03 February, 2014","path":"/blog/2014-02-03-in-a-country-in-which-people-only-want-boys/","title":"In a country in which people only want boys…"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
