You need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-story building an egg can be dropped without breaking. The question is how many drops you need to make. You are allowed to break 2 eggs in the process.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/you-are-given-2-eggs.jpg\" style=\"font-style:inherit;line-height:1.625;\"/>\n<div></div>\n<p><strong>Answer</strong>: The maximum egg drops for this method is 14 times.</p>\n<p>Instead of partitioning the floors by 10, Start at the 14th floor, and then go up 13 floors, then 12, then 11, then 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 until you get to the 99th floor, then here.  If the egg were to break at the 100th floor, it would take 12 drops (or 11 if you assume that it would break at the 100th floor).  Say, for example, that the 49th floor was the highest floor, the number of drops would be the 14th, 27th, 39th, 50th (the egg would break on the 50th floor) plus the 40, 41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48, and 49th floor for a total of 14 drops.</p>\n<p> </p>","excerpt":"…You have access to a 100-story building.
